= Preface / 序言

The exercises in this book were first prepared for use in the monthly examinations of the men of the Shanghai Municipal Staff who are required to study Chinese.

Those using the exercises found them helpful and many requests were made that they be published in book form. The effort has been, as far as possible, to arrange the exercises progressively, going from the short and more easy to those longer and more difficult.

While these exercises were prepared with special reference to the needs of the Municipal employees who are studying Chinese, it is believed they will also be found of advantage to all who wish to enlarge their knowledge of the Colloquial.

As the book is printed both in the Character and Romanization it will be very convenient for the use of those who wish to make a study of the Colloquial Character.

A very large range of subjects is treated and being in a conversational style, the Subject matter can be more easily remembered and in this form the study becomes more interesting to the student.

It is supposed that those who use the book, will have already acquired a fairly good vocabulary by the use of Dr. Pott's "Thirty Lessons" or some other such book for beginners.

While there is no vocabulary supplied, there are numerous foot notes with numbers referring to and explaining words and phrases in the text, printed in italics.

The author is conscious of the fact that these exercises are not above criticism but, he believes they will be found very useful in the study of the Dialect. He will be glad of any friendly suggestion where-by they may be improved, if published in the future.

The author desires to acknowledge the help he has received from various sources in the work of Preparation and, especially would he recognize the assistance given by The Rev. J. W. Crofoot in reading the proof.

In publishing a book like this, it is difficult to avoid various typographical errors. The mistakes are chiefly with "z" and "dz" (Many of the Chinese themselves make no distinction in these two sounds) There is an occasional omission of the aspirate "h" and sometimes final "h" is used where "k" should appear. In a few instances the final nasal "n" is misused.

Since the Character accompanies the Romanization it will be easy to obtain the correct pronunciation from the Chinese teacher. The more important errors are indicated in the errata following English index.
