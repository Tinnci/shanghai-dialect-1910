= Preface / 序言

The exercises in this book were first prepared for use in the monthly examinations of the men of the Shanghai Municipal Staff who are required to study Chinese.

Those using the exercises found them helpful and many requests were made that they be published in book form. The effort has been, as far as possible, to arrange the exercises progressively, going from the short and more easy to those longer and more difficult.

While these exercises were prepared with special reference to the needs of the Municipal employees who are studying Chinese, it is believed they will also be found of advantage to all who wish to enlarge their knowledge of the Colloquial.

As the book is printed both in the Character and Romanization it will be very convenient for the use of those who wish to make a study of the Colloquial Character.

A very large range of subjects is treated and being in a conversational style, the Subject matter can be more easily remembered and in this form the study becomes more interesting to the student.

It is supposed that those who use the book, will have already acquired a fairly good vocabulary by the use of Dr. Pott's "Thirty Lessons" or some other such book for beginners.

While there is no vocabulary supplied, there are numerous foot notes with numbers referring to and explaining words and phrases in the text, printed in italics.

The author is conscious of the fact that these exercises are not above criticism but, he believes they will be found very useful in the study of the Dialect. He will be glad of any friendly suggestion where-by they may be improved, if published in the future.

The author desires to acknowledge the help he has received from various sources in the work of Preparation and, especially would he recognize the assistance given by The Rev. J. W. Crofoot in reading the proof.

In publishing a book like this, it is difficult to avoid various typographical errors. The mistakes are chiefly with "z" and "dz" (Many of the Chinese themselves make no distinction in these two sounds) There is an occasional omission of the aspirate "h" and sometimes final "h" is used where "k" should appear. In a few instances the final nasal "n" is misused.

Since the Character accompanies the Romanization it will be easy to obtain the correct pronunciation from the Chinese teacher. The more important errors are indicated in the errata following English index.

#text(style: "italic")[KEY TO THE PRONUNCIATION OF THE ROMANIZATION USED IN THESE EXERCISES.]

The system used in these exercises is substantially the same as that adopted by the Shanghai Missionary Association and in common use in most of the books published in Romanized colloquial.

Except in few instances sounds are represented by initial and final syllables.

The Initials and Finals are classified under *High* and *Low* Tones.

== HIGH TONES.

The high pitched unaspirated tones are represented by the letters, p, m, 'v, t, ts, l, n, ng, ny, k, ky, kw, i, and w.

With the exception of the negative "'veh" the high tone mark "'" has not been used and it might well have been omitted in this case, as the tone can generally be determined from the context.

*ny* has the sound of "ni" in spaniel. \
*ky* is like "ch" in church without aspiration. \
*i* in an initial is sounded like "i" dahlia.

The aspirated tones are indicated in some cases by the use of "h" placed after the initial letter or letters, as, ph, th, tsh, kwh, ch.

h, hy and hw are initial aspirates as is also "f."

th, is pronounced like "th" in Thomas and not like "th" in thing.

*ch* is like "ch" in church. \
*hy* is like "ti" in Portia.

The "h" after an initial consonant or consonants always indicates a strong aspiration of the preceeding letters. In pronouncing an aspirate there is always an expulsion of the breath which can be easily felt on the hand if held before the mouth when speaking.

In the unaspirated tones there is not the slightest breath felt on the hand.

== LOW TONES.

Low tones are represented by the letters, -b, m, v, d, dz, z, l, ny, ng, g, j, gw, y, and w.

The initial vowel low tones are indicated by " ' " before and just above the vowel, and are, -'a, 'an, 'ah, 'au, 'aung, 'au, 'e, 'eh, 'eu, 'ok, 'oong, 'oo, 'oen, 'ung.

These are pronounced with a strong low voice as though it came from the abdomen.

== FINALS.

The vowel endings are, -a, e, i, o, u, oo, ui, ia, iau, ieu, and ie.

The nasal ending are, -an, en, ien, oen, in which the final "n" is always a nasal and should be spoken as though talking through the nose.

The sound of "an" is always like "a" in and.

The "ng" in ang, aung, oong, ung, and iang, has the sound of "ng" in song.

Final "h" and "k" in the following, -ah, ak, eh, ih, auh, ok, oeh, uh, and iak, indicate that the vowel sound preceeding ends very suddenly.

It should be borne in mind that the final "h" and "k" have no sound but are used simply to indicate the abrupt ending of the vowel sound.

This final "h" also indicates the sound of the preceeding vowel.

The sound "ah" is like "a" in at; "ak" is like "a" in what; and "eh" is like "e" in let.

== VOWEL SOUNDS.

*a* has the sound of "a" in far, except when followed by "h, k, or n", as indicated above.

*e* has the sound of "e" in prey, except when followed by "h" as indicated above.

*i* is like "i" in police except before "ng" when it has the sound of "i" in sing.

*au* has the sound of "au" in August.

*o* is like "o" in so.

*oo* is like "oo" in too, except before "ng" when it has the sound of "o" in bone.

*oe* is like the German ö.

*eu* is like the French "eu" in "Monsieur."

*u* is like "oo" in foot.

*ui* is like "ui" in fruit.

In "ih, ia, iau, and ie" we have the short sound of "i" as in it.

The sounds of certain Chinese words are represented by consonants. — These are, "ts, tsh, s, dz, m, ng, and r."

In "tsh" the "h" indicates an aspirate and not an abrupt ending sound.

The sound of "m" is like "m" chasm.

*ng* has the sound of "ng" in hanger.

*r* is a sound approximating final "r or l."

== REMARKS.

The student should know that the high and low tones are virtually the same sound differing only in the pitch of the voice.

If difficulty is experienced in pronouncing the high unaspirated "t" it will be helpful to think of the low tone "d" and attempt to pronounce it as "t." The effort will be likely to produce the correct unaspirated "t." The same would be true of high unaspirated "p" and low tone "b."

A few students have difficulty in pronouncing "ngoo" meaning I, Some omit the "n" sound, and say "goo"; others omit the "g" and say "noo." Where one has this difficulty it will be well for him to separate the "ng" and the "oo" sounds, uttering them very slowly at first, then increase the rapidity with which they are spoken until the sounds are united in "ngoo".

Many students forget that "a" in "ang" has the sound of "a" in far and are constantly giving it the sound of "an" in hand. This should be guarded against.

It should be remembered that the romanization in any system does not perfectly represent the Chinese sounds. Hence the student should give careful attention to the pronunciation of the Chinese teacher, that he may acquire the proper tone and correct accent in speaking.
